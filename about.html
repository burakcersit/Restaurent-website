Devoted to delivering the exceptionally best-frozen yogurt and sorbet, meltcone icecream  opened in August 2004 on Orchard Street in Lower Manhattan.
            
Quite a while later, we moved our retail bistro to a bigger space at  Ludlow Street (corner of East Houston St) offering a far-reaching window into an open kitchen, where our solidified sweets are handmade in little clumps, guaranteeing the most astounding quality.

We source the world over for kinds of immaculateness and perfection when conceivable sourcing locally and naturally.

We opened our second retail store at University Place (corner of the tenth Street) highly involved with clamoring Greenwich Village in late 2017.

It would be ideal if you take a trip for a preference for our new neighborhood!

With a developing rundown of 300 flavors, meltcone icecream brought into the world with the thought, as our name proposes, of being a custom “lab”, where gourmet experts and food providers are urged and invited to work with us to create one of a kind flavors for their individual menus.

To our discount customers, we offer weekday conveyance, for nothing out of pocket, and are accessible for counsel on everything solidified. It would be ideal if you don’t hesitate to call to ask for tests, to talk about our items, or to mastermind a tasting in our shop.
